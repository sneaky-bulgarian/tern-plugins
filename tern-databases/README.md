# Databases

**PostgreSQL, SQLite, Trino and Redis in [Tern](https://docs.stencil.so/tern/), with every
password in the system keychain.** Save connections, browse a database's tables or a Redis
server's keys, write queries with completion, and when you'd rather describe a query than write
it, a `?` line asks the agent of your session to write it in the editor for you.

## Install

```sh
tern plugin install github.com/sneaky-bulgarian/tern-plugins/tern-databases
```

The drivers are part of the plugin and use only Python's standard library, so there is nothing
to `pip install` and no `psql`, `trino` or `redis-cli` to have. They need Python 3.8 or later:
macOS has it with Xcode's command line tools, Homebrew's `python3` is used first when present.

## Open it

- Status line: click **Databases** (shown when Settings › Status line is on).
- Palette: **Databases**, or <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>.
- Files pane: **Open with Databases** on a `.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3` or `.db3` file adds it
  as a SQLite connection and opens it.

The status line and the palette open it beside the focused pane, or show the one already open.

## Connections

**New connection** (<kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>N</kbd>) opens a sheet for the kind, its
address, user and password; **Test** connects without saving. Pasting a URL into Host fills in
the rest: `postgres://ada@db.example.com:5432/app?sslmode=require`,
`rediss://:secret@cache.example.com:6380/0`, `trino://ada@trino.example.com:443/hive/web`.
<kbd>F2</kbd> edits the chosen connection; right-click one to duplicate or delete it.

| Kind | Connects with |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | host or socket directory, port, database, user, password; SSL `disable`, `prefer`, `require` (encrypted) or `verify-full` (certificate and host name checked); trust, password, md5 and SCRAM-SHA-256 logins |
| SQLite | an existing database file |
| Trino | host, port, catalog, schema, user; a password needs HTTPS, as Trino requires |
| Redis | host, port, password and Redis 6 ACL user, database number, TLS (`rediss://`) |

**Where the passwords are.** In the system keychain through Tern's plugin secrets: on macOS the
login keychain, service `so.stencil.tern`, account `plugin.databases.conn.<id>`. The connections
themselves, without passwords, are in the plugin's `kv.json`, shared by every Databases pane and
window. A password reaches the driver on its standard input, never in its arguments or
environment, and is never written to a file, to the pane's saved state or into a link. Deleting
a connection deletes its password.

## The pane

On the left, the connections and the chosen one's tables and views; for Redis, its keys (from
`SCAN`, with type and time to live). With more than one schema the tables sit under their
schemas, each with its table count; only the default schema (`public`, `main`, Trino's
connection schema) starts open, and a click opens or closes one. <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>F</kbd>
filters them, opening every schema with a match (for Redis, a `MATCH` pattern such as
`user:*`). Click a table for its columns, double-click it for its first rows; its right-click
menu also counts rows, inserts a `SELECT` and copies the name. Click a Redis key for its value.

On the right, the query editor over the results.

- **Completion** opens as you type (<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> asks for it): tables after
  `FROM`, `JOIN`, `INTO` and `UPDATE`, a table's columns after its alias and a dot and in the
  clauses that use them, a schema's tables after the schema and a dot, functions and keywords.
  For Redis, commands with their arguments, then key names and the command's options.
  <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd> choose, <kbd>⇥</kbd> or <kbd>⏎</kbd> inserts.
- **Running.** <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> runs the statement at the caret (for Redis, the block of
  lines around it), <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> the whole editor.
  <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>.</kbd> cancels, on the server too: PostgreSQL gets a cancel request, Trino
  a `DELETE` of the query.
- **Results** show up to the limit you pick (100 to 5,000 rows). A script gives a result per
  statement; click a row for all its values. **Copy** exports the rows as CSV, TSV, JSON or a
  Markdown table. An error marks where the server says it is in the editor.
- **Sessions.** Each run is a session of its own, so a transaction begins and ends in one run
  (<kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> on `BEGIN; …; COMMIT;`); one left open is rolled back.
  Trino's `USE` carries over to the next runs, and the head row says where they start.

## Asking the agent

Write what you want on a line starting with `?`, on its own or above a query you want changed,
and press <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>I</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> on it):

```sql
? the 10 customers who spent most this year, with their email
```

The block sends an agent of its session the request, the query under it, the connection's name
and kind, and the schema (tables, columns and their types). It never sends rows, passwords,
hosts, ports, users, database names or file paths, and tells the agent it has no access to the
database and must not look for credentials: the block runs the query with its own connection.
It asks the agent it asked
last, else one in its own tab, else an idle one; with none in the session it starts one beside
the block. The agent's query replaces the request in the editor and does not run:
<kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> brings the request back. After a failure, **Ask agent to fix**
(<kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>I</kbd>) sends the error with the statement.

## Keys

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| ⌘⏎ | Run the statement at the caret, or ask the agent when it has a `?` line |
| ⌥⌘⏎ | Run every statement in the editor |
| ⌘. | Cancel the running query |
| ⌘I, ⇧⌘I | Ask the agent for the query a `?` line describes; to fix the error shown |
| ⌃Space | Complete; ↑ ↓ choose, ⇥ or ⏎ insert, Esc close |
| ⌘/ | Comment or uncomment the lines |
| ⇥, ⇧⇥ | Indent, outdent |
| ⌥↑ ⌥↓ | Previous or next connection |
| ⌘R | Load the tables or keys again |
| ⇧⌘F | Filter the tables or keys; ↑ ↓ choose, ⏎ shows rows, Esc leaves |
| ⇧⌘N, F2 | New connection, edit the chosen one |

## How it works

`host.luau` is the `console` block. Each request runs `drivers/tdb.py` once, with the request
and the password on its standard input and one JSON answer on its output. The drivers speak the
databases' own protocols with the Python standard library: PostgreSQL's frontend/backend
protocol (each statement through Parse, Bind and a row-limited Execute, so a big result stops
at the limit), Trino's REST protocol, Redis's RESP, and SQLite through `sqlite3`. A cancel sends
the driver `SIGTERM`, and it stops the statement the way the database allows.

A block can't reach the keychain or the agents, so it asks `window.luau` over `databases:`
links, answered only for Databases panes. To store a password the window reads it from the
pane's own masked field rather than from the link. An agent request goes through `tern.kv`:
the window hands the prompt to the agent with `cx.agents`, waits for its turn to end, and sends
the answer back; the block takes the query out of its last code block. `databases.css` makes
the work area fill the pane.

## Develop

```sh
tern plugin link .          # reloads on every save
tern plugin types .         # tern.d.luau for luau-lsp
luau-lsp analyze --platform=standard --definitions=@tern=tern.d.luau $(ls *.luau | grep -v tern.d.luau)
echo '{"op":"test","conn":{"kind":"sqlite","path":"app.db"}}' | python3 drivers/tdb.py
```
